# nvim
This is my `~/.config/nvim`. 

This expected to change dramatically as I become more proficient in Neovim, and exists for personal use and as a reference (but I'd caution against using this as your *only* reference because I am still learning).

I'm going to try to make this as modular as possible, using Lua for the config files and [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for the package manager.
